# Experiment--02-Implementation-of-combinational-logic
Implementation of combinational logic gates.
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.

F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D .
## Equipments Required:
 Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher.
 
 Software – Quartus prime.

## Theory :
Logic gates are electronic circuits which perform logical functions on one or more inputs to produce one output.

OR Gate:

The OR gate is a fundamental digital logic gate that operates on two binary inputs, producing an output of 1 if at least one input is 1. It symbolizes logical disjunction and is essential in building logical circuits and decision-making processes in computers and electronics.

AND Gate:

The AND gate is a fundamental digital logic gate with two inputs and one output. It produces a high output (1) only when both input signals are high (1). If any input is low (0), the output remains low. It's a building block for more complex logic circuits and is integral in digital computations.

NOT Gate:

The NOT gate is a fundamental digital logic gate. It has a single input and a single output. The output is the inverse of the input: if the input is high (1), the output is low (0), and vice versa. It's a basic building block in digital circuits, used for logic inversion.

## Procedure :
1.Create a project with required entities.

2.Create a module along with respective file name.

3.Run the respective programs for the given boolean equations.
